Favorite City Script and Tests

This project includes a Python script that outputs a message for a favorite city and a test suite to ensure its functionality. It demonstrates best practices in Python coding, including modular design, error handling, and unit testing.
Overview

The script, favorite_city.py, defines a function that prints a message based on the name of a city. A separate test file, test_favorite_city.py, provides unit tests to validate the function's behavior for both valid and invalid city inputs.
