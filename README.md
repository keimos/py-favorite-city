Favorite City Test

This Python program helps users identify their favorite cities by collecting and analyzing city preferences. The program prompts users to enter a list of cities they have visited or wish to visit, then asks them to rank these cities based on personal preference. Using this data, the program organizes the rankings and displays the top favorite cities in order. It also provides the option to filter cities by specific criteria such as country, climate, or activities. Additionally, the program can visualize the results using bar charts to show the popularity of each city, making it easy for users to explore and prioritize their favorite travel destinations.
